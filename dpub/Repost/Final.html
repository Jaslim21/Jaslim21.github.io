    For my repost project I based it around a bunch of quotes from Keith Haring and his work. I put his quotes into an online conversational bot named Alice, and included her responses to Haring's quotes.

    I reposted my text onto VSCO's Journal. The VSCO Journal has a strict layout but I wanted to see how i could change the way it appears to the viewer.

    Because Keith Haring has some black and white prints I used these to created the illusion that there is no fixed layout on VSCO. My aim was to make the usually clean and proper layout look like a messy hand made scrapbook kind of thing.
