      <strong>Pretending</strong>
      you <em>know</em> what you’re doing
      <br>
      is almost
      the same as <strong>knowing</strong>
      what you are doing,
      <br>
      <br>
      so just accept that
      <br><em>you know
what you’re doing even if you don’t</em>
<br>
<br>
and
<br>
<br>
 <strong>do it.</strong>
