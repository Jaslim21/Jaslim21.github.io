		<br>
		<ol>
		<li>There are three states of being.
		<br><h6> Not knowing,</h6>
		<br><h5> action and </h5>
		<br><h4> completion.</h4></li>

		<br>
		<li> Accept that everything is a draft.
		<br> It helps to get
		<br>
		<div class="done"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; done </em> </li>
		</div>

		<br>
		<li>There is <h2>no</h2> editing stage.</li>

		<br>
		<li>Pretending you know what you’re doing
		is almost the same as knowing what you
		are doing,
		<br>
		so just accept that you know
		what you’re doing even if you don’t
		and do it.</li>

		<br>
		<li><h1>Banish procrastination.</h1>
		<br> If you wait more
		than a week to get an idea done,
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <h2>abandon it.</h2> </li>

		<br>
		<li>The point of being
		<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ____
		<br> is not to finish but
		to get <h1>other</h1> things
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ____.</li>

		<br>
		<li>Once you’re done you can
			<h6>throw it away.</h6>
		Laugh at <h2>p&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;f&nbsp;e&nbsp;c&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;.</h2>
			<br> It’s <h1>b&nbsp;or&nbsp;in&nbsp;g&nbsp;</h1> and keeps

		<br>
		<li>People without dirty hands are <h6>wrong.</h6>
		Doing something makes you
		<br> <h1>right.</h1></li>

		<br>
		<li>Failure counts as
			<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ____.

		<br>
		<li>If you have an idea and publish it on the
